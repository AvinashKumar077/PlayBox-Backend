 Comment Fetching Notes:


ðŸ‘‰ Why do we use $lookup twice?
 - First $lookup fetches video details (to know which video the comment is on).
 - Second $lookup fetches the user details (who wrote the comment).

ðŸ‘‰ Why do we use $arrayElemAt inside $project?
 - $lookup returns an array, even if there's only one matching document.
 - $arrayElemAt extracts the first element, so we get a single object instead of an array.
 
ðŸ‘‰ Why do we use pagination with $skip and $limit?
 - $skip ignores previous pages of comments ((page - 1) * limit).
 - $limit ensures we don't fetch too many comments at once, improving performance.
 - This prevents overwhelming the database and speeds up response time.

 Commenting System Notes:

     - A comment must have text, otherwise it wouldn't make sense!

  ðŸ‘‰ Why store 'owner' and 'video' in the comment?
